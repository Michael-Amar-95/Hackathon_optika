#Eye Strabismus Surgery Prediction Model
This project was developed as part of a data science hackathon in collaboration with Microsoft and Ichilov Hospital. The aim of the project was to build a predictive model for strabismus surgery outcomes. The data we worked with included information from eye surgeons about patients' strabismus angles, the surgical angles performed, and the post-surgery strabismus angles.

Problem Statement
Strabismus surgery is a complex procedure, and one of the key challenges is accurately predicting the surgical angle needed to correct the patient's strabismus. Our goal was to develop a model that, given the initial strabismus angle, would predict the angle at which the surgery should be performed in order to achieve optimal results.

Approach
To solve this problem, we built several machine learning models and tested their predictive performance on the data. The models used in this project include:

Decision Trees
XGBoost
Linear Regression
Sigmoid Function Prediction
Best Results
The XGBoost model yielded the best results in terms of prediction accuracy. However, we believe that with further tuning, the sigmoid model has the potential to deliver even more accurate predictions.

Outcome
Our approach was selected to be presented at AAPOS, the premier conference for strabismus surgery, which is a significant achievement for our team and for the advancement of predictive models in the medical field.
